# Using Terraform :earth_americas:
## Template
This is a basic template based off my first time using Terraform.
This template makes use of:
- AWS
- Variables
- Scripts
- Private Subnet Example
- Public Subnet Example
- Private Instance Example
- Public Instance Example

## To Begin
To start run the command `terraform init`
This will initialise terraform and pull the required plugins for your provider, ie AWS.

## Terraform Documentation
 Please click [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html) to view full documentation.

## To Note
Please note this template was set up for AWS(Amazon Web Services)
Some core data is blank so running the command `terraform plan` will fail if this required information is not filled out before hand.
